# board-game-helper
A helper library for board games.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MarianoGappa/board-game-helper.png)](https://travis-ci.org/MarianoGappa/board-game-helper)

## Status

- Chess implementation still not feature complete: only castling remains! Some tidy up outstanding.
- Highly experimental at the moment; implementation might change drastically at any time

## Classes

- Game: a Game has a Board, some Players and some Rules
- A Board has a collection of Cells (which can have Pieces) and a Horizontal width
- Pieces have an owner (a Player) and a location within the Board
- Pieces can move within the Board. A Movement has a Piece and a pair of Deltas.

```
abstract class Game(board: Board, players: List[Player], rules: Rules)
abstract class Board(val grid: Vector[Option[Piece]], xSize: Int)
abstract class Piece(val x: Int, val y: Int, val owner: Player)
case class Movement(fromPiece: Piece, dx: Int, dy: Int)
```

## Chess

- Import a ChessBoard
```
val game = ChessGame.fromString(
        """........
          |........
          |........
          |...♜....
          |........
          |........
          |........
          |........""".stripMargin)
```
- Get all movements from the piece on (3, 3) (zero based)
```
val board = game.board
implicit val rules = game.rules

// In real code we wouldn't do '.get.get'; in this case we know it's a Cell and contains a Rook
val movements = board.get(3,3).get.get.movements(board)
```
- Print them out!
```
movements map board.move foreach (b => println(b + "\n"))

## Use cases

- Making board game AIs
- UI API for board games (e.g. asking it "check mate?", or "which cells can I move to?" to highlight them)
- Solving/researching board games
- Inventing board games

## Short term TODO

- Research repositories
- Optimise canMoveTo
- Implement castling
- Remove players property from Game
- Change pieces' class names to unicode characters

## Long term TODO

- Implement PegSolitaireGame as proof of concept
- Solve PegSolitaireGame as proof of concept
- Implement Chess Game as proof of concept
- Implement partial/complete algebraic chess notation to Game: can display and practice from there
- Invent awesome game using this library
